<h3>Bidirectional LSTM for Medical Relation Extraction task</h3>
Mining relationships between treatment(s) and medical problem(s)
is vital in the biomedical domain. This helps in various applications,
such as decision support system, safety surveillance, and new treat-
ment discovery. We build a deep learning approach that utilizes
both word level and sentence-level representations to extract the
relationships between treatment and problem.
